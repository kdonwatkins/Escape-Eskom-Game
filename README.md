# Escape-Eskom-Game

## Programs used:
* Python
* Pygame

## Description:
* This is a simple game run with PyGame in which you have to ensure that the character in the game manages to evade the Eskom logos and be subjected to load-shedding!


## Goal of the game/user:
* The goal of the game is to get the character to the lightbulb on the other corner of the screen, after which you may start the game again as the Eskom logos will start in a different position in the next game.
* This is a simple and quick game to run and is for anyone looking for an easy, extremely straightforward game to play.


## How it works:
* Various images are brought into the game and set to their various positions 
* The game will start with 4 Eskom logos moving in a negative x-axis direction. They will be moving at different speeds to make each turn unpredictable. Also note, two of the "enemies" will always start in a random y-position.
* The player then needs to move the main character across the screen to reach to lightbulb without being touched by any of the Eskom logos. 
* The Eskom logos are moved automatically from the start and the main character is moved either up, down, left, or right depending on which key the user hits.
* All the player has to do from the get-go is move their character - simple!
